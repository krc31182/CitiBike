# CitiBike Challenge

In this assignment I took on a role as Jersey City Citi Bike analyst. I put together a presentation for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. 

I used Tableau to compile all of the data from the summer of 2022 to get a better understanding of how people are using the program. And untimately decide on ways to improve it. 

The data consists of all the times citizens used Citi bike from June, July, August, and September of 2022.

My goal is to provide the city with information that can be used to make decisions on the program moving forward.




## FAQ

#### What are our top performing stations and why?


#### What are our worst performing stations and why?


#### How has this summer compared to the summer of 2021?

#### Was this a successful summer and is the program heading in the right direction?

#### Is the program working for people who want to ride a bike to work rather than drive or take other forms of transportation?

#### Are we seeing tourism and casual ridership to explore the city?

#### Does it make sense to keep up the maintenance of all of our current stations?


## Analysis

Link to my story on tableau Public:

The summer of 2022 showed an increase in ridership for each month (June-Sept) from 2021 numbers. With an increase of 31% in June, 24% in July, 18% in August, and 8% in September. 
The total amount of riders for this period in 2022 was 431,279. In 2021 it was 345,158 for this same period. 


There are 72 total station across Jersey City. With the busiest stations being primarily along the waterfront areas. This is a positive sign as the majority of businesses as well as attractions that seem to be driving traffic and tourism to that area. There is high usage in areas of the Hoboken Waterfront, Pier A Park, Historical Museum, and Stevens Institue of Technology.  
Investors and entrepreneurs should be ecouraged to invest in our city with a lot of potential along the New York skyline. 
Our lowest performing stations are all west of the New Jersey Turnpike. 

In total we had 266,427 rides taken by members and 164,852 by non membership riders. The membership program is attracting a high number of riders through the week. At our busiest stations the casual rider usage spikes significantly on the weekends. Our membership riders make up the majority of riders through the weekdays. The number of rides being taken through the weekdays is a positive sign that our membership program is working.


Of our lowest volume stations, three stand out. JC097, JC107, and JCSYS. There are very few rides being taken at these locations. Perhaps due to the area they are in. Being outside of the turnpike, they do not have any tourism destinations close. They also aren't being used by the local community to travel. 
Perhaps partnering with business in the area to offer discounts would imporve ridership in these areas? 
Perhaps relocating them to a different street, or removing them all together would make sense. Bringing the bikes to more usable area is also worth discussing. Further examination into the problem should be considered.
